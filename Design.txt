Low level Design
=====================
1. Line by Line, Read the Csv file--> Read the text in Csv, Example of line is given below
		a.Need to make file read function separate.
2. Need to parse the above record and put into a variable of below structre(strtok)


3. sqllite libary(Code in binary form) + API (Add(2,4)

(Exe(API) --> LIbrary)

4. Create separate file for each .h , source file and data base connect file
 source:
 main.c 
 csv_reader.c
 database_connect.c
 
 include:
 csv_reader.h
 database_connect.h
